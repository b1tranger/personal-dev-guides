If you are on a line that you are following with most efficiency to achieve whatever you're on to, then no words in the world should let you down nor make it hard for you to achieve that thing..!
You sent
does this mean that, if what I wish for is right, and my plan is a well-thought one, and if I am following it consistently, I should follow it through until the end?
Arriesgado
Yeah, you should..!

You win or you lose, no matter the final outcome, you will get the taste of your achievement..! 

For that, you may ask for what should you do but not ask people to justify your thoughts or plans on what you are gonna do..!
You sent
so ask "what would be best to do?"

but not "Am I doing it right?"
You sent
nah, it seems not quite right
You sent
it's not really about asking, but should be more about taking the responsibility of the decision.
You sent
but yes, I could ask the question "Am I doing it right?"
Arriesgado
You can ask both if that has no negative impact on you..! 

You can ask "what would be best to do?" when you are about to start something... Once started you may ask  "Am I doing it right?" rather than the first one..!
